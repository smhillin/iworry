In China, civil society is pressuring the government to replace the current dual-market, mixed-message ivory legislature with a full blanket ban.
<div>

At the opening session of the Chinese People‚Äôs Political Consultative Conference on March 3, former NBA star Yao Ming delivered a petition calling for an outright ban of the sale, import, purchase and transport of ivory and ivory products. Among the signatories were influential heads of big business ‚Äì many of which belong to the ruling Chinese Communist Party ‚Äì such as Wang Wenjing (Chairman and CEO of Yonyou Software) and Liu Jun (Chairman of Eagle International Holdings).

If this was adopted, it would seal the legal loophole that currently enables criminal syndicates to launder ‚Äúblood ivory‚Äù from the black market into commercial circulation.

... A series of public service announcements entitled ‚ÄúSay no to ivory‚Äù featuring the popular actress and basketball star have gone viral on Sina Weibo, China‚Äôs Twitter. Then on February 27, a number of big business CEOs in China ‚Äì including 10 individuals from the Forbes 2013 China Rich List ‚Äì released a pledge to never purchase, possess, or give ivory as a gift.
