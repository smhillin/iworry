"It's horrible because all I see are dead elephants," the 42-year-old conservationist said as he led a march along Hollywood Road and nearby streets, calling on the government to ban the domestic ivory trade.

"We see these things in movies and documentaries," he said, pointing to the shiny shopfronts with ivory displays, "and we don't believe it, but here we are now and we have seen it with our own eyes."You don't find this in our shops in Kenya, but somebody here is proud to have pieces of ivory from dead elephants in their shop. It's so bad."
