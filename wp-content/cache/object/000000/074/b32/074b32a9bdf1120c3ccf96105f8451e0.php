So every time I hear of an elephant beingÂ slaughtered for their tusks, I think of my son. And how it would feel for him if I was brutally and sadistically murdered in front of him.Â And how would I feel knowing my last breaths were taken watching fear and despair on his face? Would I yell at him to run? Would I
beg for my life? Would I tell my murderers to take me somewhere else so he doesnâ€™t have to watch me be senselessly killed? I wouldÂ do all of that and more. I would fight, plead, beg, run, protect my sonâ€¦and I would hope against hope that someone somewhere outÂ there was fighting to make sure this didnâ€™t happen to others like me. How can we think the elephants arenâ€™t thinking and feeling all ofÂ these things and more? And knowing this, how can we allow this slaughter to continue to happen?";s:10:"post_title";s:11:"Alisen Down";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:11:"alisen-down";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2015-04-20 11:22:03";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2015-04-20 11:22:03";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:47:"http://iworry.org/?post_type=quotes&#038;p=2411";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:6:"quotes";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
