Governor Chris Christie this week signed into law bipartisan legislation prohibiting individuals from importing, selling or purchasing any ivory or rhinoceros horn product. S-2012 makes federal prohibitions applicable to the ivory and rhinoceros horn trade within New Jersey, and includes strict penalties for those caught dealing in the black market of this industry. The bill will help protect previous and endangered wildlife by targeting traffickers with stiff financial penalties.

<span style="color: #111111;">‚ÄúWith this legislation, we are making it clear that there are strict consequences for individuals who would seek to profit from trafficking in these products and their harvesting that brings far-reaching, harmful consequences on endangered animal populations,‚Äù said Governor Chris Christie. ‚ÄúThese stricter measures will help to reduce the amount of criminal activity that surrounds this industry while protecting wildlife populations that are already seriously threatened from this harmful practice.‚Äù¬†</span>
