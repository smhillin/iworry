&nbsp;

LastÂ week, in the US State of Vermont, the House Committee on Fish, Wildlife and Water Resources began consideration ofÂ H.297, a bill to prohibit the import, sale, offer for sale, purchase, barter, or possession with intent to sell of any ivory, ivory product, rhinoceros horn, or rhinoceros horn product.

Those fighting FORÂ the ban includedÂ wildlife conservationists, middle school students and drummer, Jonathan Fishman. Those in opposition to itÂ included antiques dealers and music teachers,Â who expressed concernsÂ about ceasing piano salesÂ withÂ legally-obtained ivory. Â However, musician Jonathan Fishman appealed for a complete ban in ivory and rhino horn sales. Fishman was supported by Pat Bosco, a retired fish and wildlife special agent who said, 'IfÂ there's a legal market for ivory, there's always going to be the illegal trade behind it.'

<h2 style="text-align: center;">*** TAKE ACTION ***</h2>
&nbsp;

With H.297 already under consideration, now is the time for us to showÂ OVERWHELMINGÂ support for the Bill, we need to let the Committee Members know that all of us, be we in Vermont, or anywhere else in the world, are urging them to support the Bill and with that play a key role in saving elephants and rhinos from extinction. Â With each additional US State that introduces legislation banning the sale of ivory and rhino horn we create a swelling of support and a critical momentum, which will help other States presently considering or intending to consider legislation to make the right decision.

Ethically, morally, environmentally and financially there is only one decision to be made in a Nation that is the second largest consumer of ivory products, a complete ban on the sale of ivory, and rhino horn; failure to recognise the implications of any sales of products containing ivory or rhino horn will have devastating consequences onÂ elephants and rhinos.

Let your voice be heard, write a polite, passionate and informed letter to the Committee Members, let them know what this means to you and what the passing of this Bill would mean for future generations, not just of elephants and rhinos, but people too.
