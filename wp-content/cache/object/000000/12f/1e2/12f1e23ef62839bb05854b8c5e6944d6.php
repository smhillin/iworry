On arrival, Dr. Mijele first darted the bull with a spear in his head - he immediately slumped onto his haunches. What was so heartwarming to witness was his injured friend standing vigil over his slumped form. Quickly Dr. Mijele darted the second bull, allowing the team to treat both elephants at the same time.

Dr Mijele began working on the bull with the severe head injury and carefully removed the spear head lodged in his skull. This immediately caused haemorrhaging from both the temple and the trunk, which was alarming yet expected given the extent of his injury. The wound was soon cleaned and plugged and with the spear head removed this bullâ€™s chance of a full recovery is very positive.

His recumbent friend who was laying close by with less severe injuries was then attended to. His wounds were treated by Dr Mijele who cleaned them extensively, before administering antibiotics and packing the wounds with green clay, which is a natural substance to ward off infection.

Both patients were then given the reversal antidote and in no time they rose to their feet and together ambled off across the plains whilst the team looked on, satisfied with a dayâ€™s good work and confident in the knowledge that today everyone involved had made a significant difference in saving the lives of these two precious and magnificent creatures.Â </span>
