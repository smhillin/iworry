At Cannes Encheres an auction house in France an entire haul of ivory was acquired by buyers from China, the world's biggest ivory market.

"In terms of volume, this is a new record for us," said Alexandre Debussy, the director of Cannes Encheres, which facilitated the sale.

"Our previous record in the spring was 920 pounds (420kg)," he added.

"Tonnes of ivory are languishing in French people's attics, and we get requests all the time for it to be shifted," Debussy said.</span>
