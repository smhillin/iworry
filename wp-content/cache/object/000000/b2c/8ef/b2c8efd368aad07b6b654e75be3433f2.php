In excess of 40,000 signatures were registered from people around the world calling on CITES to say NO to ivory and more specifically expressing a view that there should be a global ban on the sale of ivory.

Once again our thanks to everyone who signed and shared the petition, helping us secure a huge amount of signatures in such a small amount of time. Let's hope Mr Scanlon gives the petition the due recognition it deserves, alongside various other petitions and reports, stating categorically the increase in ivory poaching being witnessed throughout Africa at this time.
