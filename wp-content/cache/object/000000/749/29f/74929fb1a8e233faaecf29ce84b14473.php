As 18¬†of Swaziland‚Äôs wild elephants emerge from quarantine to be met by hoards of visitors to zoos in Texas, Kansas and Nebraska, we consider how the law came to fail these elephants.<img class="wp-image-2932 alignright" src="http://iworry.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/a.jpg" alt="A herd of african elephants walking away from the camera in a straight line in Tarangire National Park, Tanzania" width="621" height="323" />

Big Game Parks (BGP), an independent wildlife management organisation in Swaziland, applied to export the elephants, claiming over population was threatening rhinos, despite only being home to 35 elephants. Such over population, they claimed, would result in culling if an exportation permit was denied. Transportation to the U.S. or death in Swaziland falsely represented the choice, with inadequate consideration of alternatives such as relocation within Africa, corridor creation, or water point management.
<h4><em><strong>Over 80¬†conservationists¬†appealed against import</strong></em></h4>
BGP then had to apply to‚Ä¶BGP for the next approval. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) requires separate scientific and management authorities, however in Swaziland the head of BGP is listed as both, meaning a piece of the already threadbare red tape was removed.

Next, the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) had to approve the import, using CITES and U.S Endangered Species Act (ESA) criteria. Listed on Appendix 1 of CITES, Swaziland elephants should attract the highest protection and had they been categorised as ‚Äòendangered‚Äô not ‚Äòthreatened‚Äô under ESA, the import may never have happened. The zoos had to show that the import was not primarily for commercial purposes, or detrimental to the species.<img class="wp-image-2676 alignright" src="http://iworry.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ele-1024x768.jpg" alt="ele" width="488" height="366" />

The second limb seems worryingly wide, offering protection only to elephants intended to be part of a mass transportation. It is a slur on CITES‚Äô and USFWS‚Äô regulatory clout that the zoos were successful in arguing that such transportation was not for commercial purposes. The Swaziland 18¬†will never be returned to the wild, and the zoos involved have invested millions of dollars on this import, reliant on revenue sky rocketing as a result. Furthermore, it‚Äôs argued that sales of wild elephants provides financial incentive to operate sub-standard conservation practices, allowing cash-rich western zoos to swoop in and exploit.
<h4><em><strong>No¬†proof that Swaziland and the zoos explored alternative options</strong></em></h4>
However, USFWS are considering 'up-listing' elephants from ‚Äòthreatened‚Äô to ‚Äòendangered‚Äô, meaning imports would be entirely prohibited in the U.S. unless it can be proven to enhance the survival of the species ‚Äì a dramatic increase in protection.

<h3><strong>Tanzania spurns the burn - why?
</strong></h3>
As Kenya prepares for the world‚Äôs biggest ivory burn on 30th April, committed to the symbolic destruction of the illegal trade through obliterating the market, neighbouring Tanzania, with whom they share intelligence reporting, are resolute in their defiance against this approach.

Despite mounting pressure from CITES, the U.S, the EU, Kenya and Uganda, Tanzania‚Äôs stockpile of over 34,000 confiscated tusks remains under tight security at a warehouse in Dar es Salaam.

Malawi also sought to destroy several million dollars‚Äô worth of seized ivory which had been smuggled over the border from Tanzania. However, this destruction was delayed as Tanzania argued that the tusks should be preserved in order to be used as evidence in court against poachers. A court in Malawi has now ordered a public destruction of the stockpiles.
<h4><em><strong>Conservationists argue, similarly to drugs¬†and illegal firearms, ivory is contraband as should be destroyed</strong></em></h4>
The Tanzanian government applied for a legal sale to international markets, with the proceeds being spent on strengthening its attack on poaching and improving wildlife conservation in general. This argument is heavily criticised, and previous ‚Äúone-off‚Äù ivory sales have been chastised for propagating legal and illegal international demand for ivory.<img class="wp-image-3266 alignright" src="http://iworry.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/a.jpg" alt="a" width="552" height="345" />

The debate is more complex than simply labelling Tanzania as a rogue state in the fight to save the African elephant. It was Tanzania who prosecuted the notorious poaching kingpin, known as the ‚ÄúIvory Queen‚Äù, and who this month handed out 35 year sentences to <a href="http://shanghaiist.com/2016/03/20/chinese_poachers_jailed_for_30_years.php">two Chinese nationals</a>¬†for ivory smuggling.
<h4><strong><em>Tanzania holds the largest ivory stockpile in the world</em></strong></h4>
However, a refusal to engage in the symbolic destruction of ivory by Tanzania is not a decision made in isolation. The demand for ivory remains an international crisis, requiring an international response. Any market whatsoever through which to sell ivory attaches a price to a dead elephant, and, as has been asserted since the ban was being debated nearly thirty years ago, ‚Äòtrade <em>anywhere</em>, affects elephants <em>everywhere‚Äô.
