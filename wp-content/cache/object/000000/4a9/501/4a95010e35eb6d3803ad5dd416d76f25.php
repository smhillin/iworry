Those with licenses may only sell ivory only if they owned the items before the species was listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973. (International sales of new ivory were banned in 1989 by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.)

But this does little to deter traders, who consider the penalties and fines a cost of doing business. Further, marketers routinely treat ivory with chemicals to make the pieces appear older and therefore legal for sale and trade. Testing to determine the ivory‚Äôs age is expensive and therefore not a realistic law-enforcement tool.

We need a better law now.
