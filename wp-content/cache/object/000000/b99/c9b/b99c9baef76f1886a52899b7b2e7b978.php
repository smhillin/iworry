Elephants have roamed the wild for 15 million years, but today this iconic species face the biggest threat to survival due to continued ivory poaching. As long as there is a demand for ivory, elephants continue to be killed for their tusks. Today it is estimated up to 25,000 elephants are killed annually.
<h3>Reasons to save the elephant:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>If we donâ€™t act now elephants could face localized extinctions.</li>
 	<li>In some countries of Africa including Sierra Leone and Senegal, elephants have already been driven to extinction.</li>
 	<li>Communities across Africa are dependent on elephants for an income through tourism. Saving the elephants also means preventing poverty, sustaining livelihoods and promoting sustainable tourism.</li>
 	<li>Elephants are a keystone species. Other animals, plants and entire ecosystems rely on them for survival.</li>
 	<li>â€˜As go the elephants, so do the trees.â€™ Elephants are known as â€˜natureâ€™s gardenersâ€™, plants and trees rely on elephants to disperse their seeds far and wide through their dung.</li>
 	<li>Elephant's large footprints act as water collectors for smaller animals.</li>
 	<li>By uprooting trees to feed, they control the tree population leaving grasses to thrive and sustain animals such as wildebeests and zebras.</li>
 	<li>Elephants share the same emotions and cognitive behavior as humans. They grieve for their lost loved ones, they feel fear, joy and empathy and are highly praised for their intelligence.</li>
</ul>
