In a statement sent to the media, conservancy marketing manager Elodie Sampere said the "aerial ranger" will be ready by June next year.

"We were able to conduct successful tests in December 2013 and the drone then returned to the USA for final work. We have been told by Airware, our partners, that an operational deployment will be in place from June 2014," reads the statement.

It says the drone will be key in containing poaching, especially of the endangered black and Northern white rhinos. Ol Pejeta Conservancy is home to at least four of the Northern White Rhinos, out of the total world population of six.
