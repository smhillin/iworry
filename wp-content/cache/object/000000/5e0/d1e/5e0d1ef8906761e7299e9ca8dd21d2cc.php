Separated by 1000s of miles, sitting on different continents and facing very different challenges, both countries are united in their determination to end the illegal ivory trade.

More and more countries across the globe are destroying their ivory stockpiles: the roll includes Gabon, the Philippines, USA, China, France, Chad, Belgium, Hong Kong, Kenya and Ethiopia, making UAE and Congo the 11th and 12th countries to do so within the last three years.

Why are these countries destroying their ivory?Â  In part, it is in protest: to send a message to the world community to stop buying ivory.Â  In part, it is a message: symbolizing a countriesâ€™ intention to adopt a zero-tolerance attitude to poachers and traffickers.
