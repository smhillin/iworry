Their argument: if the transfer is not approved, they will have to be culled.

At <em>iworry</em> and the <a href="http://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org" target="_blank">DSWT</a>, we firmly believe no elephants should endure captivity, the species require space to roam, being kept¬†alone and in confinement is tantamount to torture for such an animal.

That Governments are appearing to sell their wildlife under unethical and outdated wildlife management practices, shipping their natural heritage to a zoo thousands of miles away, without exploring other alternatives is extremely worrying, especially at a time when across Africa, one elephant is being killed every 15 minutes by ivory poachers.

Read the statement that the DSWT has signed, along with other elephant experts, condemning the transfer <a href="http://iworry.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Letter_Signed_DSWT.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
