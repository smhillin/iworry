Africaâ€™s elephants could now be extinct before our grandchildren see them in the wild. This has created strong links with another Eastern powerhouse, China. Surging demand for illegal ivory from that countryâ€™s middle class has plugged Kenya, and China, into the dark side of the world economy in a way that could hardly be foreseen two decades ago.
