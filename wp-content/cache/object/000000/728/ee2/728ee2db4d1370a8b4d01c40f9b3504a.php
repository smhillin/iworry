Ian shares the below quote with us:

'Our hearts bleed in the knowledge that if we continue living as we are, elephants will no longer exist in the wild ten short years from today. These magnificent creatures experience the same emotional complexity as humans and their young suffer overwhelming and prolonged grief after witnessing a parent killed for ivory. The Ian Somerhalder Foundation attests that all life on this planet isÂ interwoven and interconnected, therefore their suffering andÂ grief is ultimately OUR suffering and grief. The IS FoundationÂ stands alongside <a href="http://www.dswt.org" target="_blank">The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust</a> in support of their iworry campaign to stop the senseless killing of these majestic animals.'
