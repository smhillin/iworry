Poachers are taking these animals, sometimes in unimaginably high quantities, and using weapons of war to efficiently kill large numbers of wild, innocent animals. Sub-machine guns, night vision goggles and even helicopters are used to slaughter up to <strong>100</strong> <strong>elephants each da</strong>y. It's not just animals lives at risk, in the last <strong>10</strong> years, <strong>1,000* rangers were killed</strong> protecting wildlife in the ‚Äúwar‚Äù against poachers.</p>
<p>The profits from wildlife trafficking are being traced to terrorist groups which in turn poses an increased threat to national security and economic stability. Wildlife crime is believed to be valued at approximately $23 billion.</p>
