Sudan is the only male of the northern white rhino subspecies remaining, thanks to ruthless poaching that has reached catastrophic levels in recent years. His relatives and ancestors have been slaughtered for their horns, which are sold for huge amounts of money in Asia, where they're believed to cure a range of ailments.

Fixed with radio transmitters to increase security, Sudan is surrounded by armed rangers at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, who work day and night to keep the 40-year-old Sudan and two female rhinos of his subspecies alive. (There are only two other northern white rhinos in the world, two females also in captivity.)
