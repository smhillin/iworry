Great tuskers are extremely rare in Africa today, as these have long been the prized targets for poachers. These bigger elephants, which typically bear larger tusks, carry strong genes for survival and are preferred by<span class="text_exposed_show"> females. Left alone, they would father the majority of calves, but poaching has relentlessly cut down big elephants at the height of their reproductive power, preventing these males from passing on their genes for larger tusks and overall fitness to survive.</span>

In most populations there are always some tuskless elephants. <strong>But, in heavily poached populations, the ratio of tuskless elephants increases as poaching continues.</strong> While this may seem like progress from an anti-poaching perspective, elephants need their tusks to perform a variety of functions. Without tusks, the survival of the species could be seriously compromised.
