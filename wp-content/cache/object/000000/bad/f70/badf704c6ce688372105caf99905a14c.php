A situation that at the very least, would remove any and all confusion around the sale of ivory, it would be illegal. The realists might have been looking for delegates to stand up and call for immediate international funds to enhance security at transit ports from where ivory is being smuggled. They may also have expected a commitment from CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) to categorically state that their ivory trading mechanism has been a shambolic failure, noting that since the â€˜twoâ€™ CITES approved so called â€˜one-offâ€™ sales of ivory in 1997 and 2008 there has been a measured increase in elephant poaching to fuel the ivory trade. Such an admission would have provided an opportunity for CITES to address the situation by extending the ban and implementing punishments on those countries deemed to be failing in their ability to halt the illegal export of ivory from their borders and those failing to monitor and act upon the sale of illegal ivory.
