<span style="color: #141823;">The analysis, conducted throughÂ our <em>iworryÂ </em></span><span style="color: #141823;">campaign, compared the value of elephants to local economies to pro</span><span class="text_exposed_show" style="color: #141823;">fits netted through the illegal ivory trade. Between January and August 2014, researchers tallied approximately 17.8 metric tons of ivory seized worldwide, harvested from 1,940 poached elephants. Most of these seizures occurred in Kenya, Gabon, China, and Vietnam, countries identified by CITES as doing relatively little to stem the tide of black-market ivory.

WeÂ estimate the raw-ivory value of a poached elephant to be $21,000. In contrast, a living elephant is worth more than $1.6 million over its lifetime, largely because of its eco-tourism draw. The report lists travel companies, airlines, and local economies as benefiting from this largess of the worldâ€™s largest land mammal, whereas the ivory trade may fund criminal and terrorist groups.</span>
