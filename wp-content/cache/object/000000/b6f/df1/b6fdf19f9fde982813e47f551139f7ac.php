New Jersey, New York and California have introduced <a title="Bans" href="http://ecowatch.com/2015/10/05/california-ban-ivory-trade/" target="_blank">in-state bans</a> on ivory and rhino horn products to reduce demand for ivory in the USA and stem the number of elephants being slaughtered for their tusks. However,Â all loopholes must be closed and all US States must be courageous and implement such measures. Only when we work together can we secure a future for elephants.

<h1><strong>Stop the import of elephants to U.S zoos</strong></h1>
In March, despite public outcry, <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/01/160122-Swaziland-Elephants-Import-US-Zoos/" target="_blank">18 elephants were flown from Swaziland</a> to the US and separated between three zoos, Dallas zoo, Sedgwick County zoo and Henry Doorly zoo. The zoos agreed to pay $450,000 in exchange for the elephants.

Under international law set by CITES, Swazilandâ€™s elephants are threatened with extinction. Therefore, CITES stipulates, tradeÂ <span class="text_exposed_show">in the species must be only be authorized in exceptional circumstances. H<a href="http://1.usa.gov/1NkXHDs" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3311"><img class="alignright wp-image-3311" src="http://iworry.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/a-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="a-2" width="521" height="347" /></a>owever, the move was granted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) for exhibit and breeding purposes.</span>

Since the transfer, the USFWS are now considering re-listing African elephants to â€˜endangeredâ€™ meaning future live imports would be completely prohibited in the US. Currently African elephants are listed as 'threatened'.

USFWS requested comments from the public on this topic until 16th May and the iworry team would like to thank all our followers who took action and commented on the USFWS petition.

The moment there is any news from USFWS on this topic we will share it with you here - thank you.
