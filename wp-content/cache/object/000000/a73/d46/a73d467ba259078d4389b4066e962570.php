A ban was put in place in 1989 by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) and all international trade was prohibited in an attempt to combat this massive illegal trade.</p>
<p>Major ivory markets were eliminated and some countries in Africa experienced a steep decline in illegal killing allowing some elephant populations to recover. Following a ‚Äòone-off sale‚Äô in 2008, the illegal trade rocketed with 2011 seeing the largest seizures of ivory since records began. Elephant populations declined rapidly as poaching escalated across much of Africa, fuelling the black market.</p>

<p>Completed in 2010 by 38 African elephant range states, the AEAP identifies key objectives with clear strategies with Objective 1 being to: "Reduce illegal killing of elephants and illegal trade in elephant products".</p>
<p>The main aim of the AEAP is to address the crisis at a field level and note which physical actions are to be implemented and funded most urgently.</p>
<p>The 38 African elephant range States and authors of the Plan are: Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina¬†Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of Congo, Democratic¬†Republic of the Congo, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon,¬†Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia,¬†Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Republic of South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, Swaziland, United Republic of Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe.</p>
