<div>

Three suspects will appear in court inÂ KenyaÂ on Monday after six elephants, including four juveniles, were found shot dead in a private reserve, in one of the worst poaching incidents for several years.Â A wildlife official told The Telegraph that it is thought that killings were partly motivated by revenge against officials, as the calves, not having tusks, had no value to poachers.
