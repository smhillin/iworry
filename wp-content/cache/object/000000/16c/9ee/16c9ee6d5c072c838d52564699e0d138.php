Secretary Kerry arrived in Kenya just after 3.00pm and after a short journey through Nairobi National Park, to witness its wildlife, he visited the D<a title="DSWT" href="http://www.dswt.org" target="_blank">avid Sheldrick Wildlife Trust</a>'s Orphans' Project at 5.00pm.<span class="text_exposed_show"> Secretary Kerry was accompanied by US Ambassador Bob Godec , Kenyan Cabinet Secretary of Environment, Water and Natural Resources Professor Judy Wakhungu, and KWS Director William Kiprono. <strong>Secretary Kerry was hosted at the DSWT by Dr. Dame Daphne Sheldrick and DSWT CEO Angela Sheldrick and our wonderful keepers, where he was able to meet the 28 orphaned elephants presently at the Trust's Nursery, feed them their milk and learn the tragic stories behind why they were orphaned and are now in our care.</strong></span>

This visit follows the US State Department hosting a screening on Gardeners of Eden in Washington DC at the end of April. The film presents the reality of the ivory trade at a field level, where our teams are battling to save elephants, within the context of the international trade. We are encouraged by this further engagement today on issues related to elephant poaching and the State Department's increasing commitment to tackle the illegal wildlife trade.
