Customs authorities in Hong Kong have seized over 1,000 kg of African ivory worth almost $1.5m. This concealed shipment of 779 tusks is the third largest seizure in just three months and was smuggled by sea from Kenya via Malaysia. A routine x-ray scan of a shipping container reported to contain ‚Äúarchaeological stones‚Äù revealed the tusks hidden in five wooden crates under valueless rocks. Hong Kong is an important trade and logistics hub and authorities will not tolerate being taken advantage of by ivory smugglers. On 20 October 2012, customs officials found nearly four tonnes of ivory in two shipments worth almost $3.5m. This bust was followed by another seizure of over 1 tonne the next month. The resurgence in the trade in African ivory is driven by increasing demand in China and Thailand for jewelry and ornamental items. China is building roads, bridges, canals, dams and oil fields in Africa. The new headquarters of the African Union in Ethiopia was built and funded by China and stands as a monument of their increasing dominance on the continent. This dominance and unparalleled access to people and markets is fueling this resurgence in the ivory trade and the widespread slaughter of African elephants. Armed militia in Africa have been finance by ivory, oil, diamonds and precious minerals for over 150 years and militias like the ‚ÄúJanjaweed‚Äù and ‚ÄúLord‚Äôs Resistance Army‚Äù have been recently linked with people buying and commissioning ivory from China and Japan. In 2012, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) said that elephant poaching levels were at their highest levels in a decade and recorded ivory seizures are at their highest levels since 1989.
