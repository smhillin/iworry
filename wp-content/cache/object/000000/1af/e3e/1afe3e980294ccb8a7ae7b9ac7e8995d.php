Roberts warned that at this rate Africa‚Äôs elephants face extinction in the near future.

‚ÄúOur findings shine a bright light on Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Tanzania, Sudan, and Kenya, where poachers move across borders with near impunity, slaughter elephants with complete disregard, and use the ivory to fund violent operations across the continent. Global leaders cannot stand by while the human tragedy and poaching crisis continue,‚Äù said Roberts.

On Monday Born Free USA <a title="Report" href="http://www.bornfreeusa.org/downloads/pdf/Ivorys-Curse-2014.pdf" target="_blank">released a report</a> on their investigation into the impact of organised terrorist gangs and crime syndicates on elephant poaching to acquire ivory to fund their ‚Äòdeadly activities.‚Äô

‚ÄúIvory is a conflict, crime, and corruption issue with severe human impact. It has been a conflict resource for decades, just like blood diamonds or coltan in Central Africa, only without the same level of global attention,‚Äù said co-author of the report, Varun Vira.
