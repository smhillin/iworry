On Saturday 30th April, Kenya Wildlife Service torched over 100 tons of elephant ivory in an effort to curbÂ the demand for ivory.Â The 11 pyres represented overÂ 10,000 elephants and sent a strong message to the world -Â elephants are worth more alive.

The burn is the fourth undertaken by Kenya since 1989 and continued for over two days,Â representingÂ the largest single stockpile destruction the world hasÂ everÂ seen. This act of solidarityÂ by Kenya sends a<a href="http://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/updates/updates.asp?ID=913"><img class="alignright wp-image-3353" src="http://iworry.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/a-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="a (2)" width="485" height="323" /></a> strong statement to the world that Kenyaâ€™s wildlife heritage is not for sale. The only value in ivory is on a living elephant.Â Among those who attended the burn were representatives from the UN, Interpol, International government embassies, as well as member nations of the Giants Club which concluded its two-day summit in Nanyuki hours before the burn.

Bringing together member countries including Kenya, Gabon, Uganda and Botswana, as well as embassies including representatives of the Chinese Embassy, significant funds were pledged at the summit for conservation, which was convened as part of efforts to share knowledge and which aims to protect 50% of Africaâ€™s elephants by 2020.

Throughout the lead up to the burn, <a href="http://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/">The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust</a>Â (DSWT)Â spoke loudly about the need to protect Africa's wildlife; there are clear economic benefits but ultimately, we have a clear moral duty to protect Kenyaâ€™s and Africaâ€™s elephants and their destruction weighs heavily on our collective conscience.

But put simply, poaching and the ivory trade is not an African issue, it is a global one, and for that, it requires a global solution.

As the flames die away, the DSWTÂ continue theirÂ daily work in partnership with the Kenya Wildlife Service: to preserve, protect and conserve Kenyaâ€™s wildlife. Tirelessly continuing the fight for the survival and future of elephants.
