At the 11th hour, the burn was postponed as the Government sought to include a further 2.6 tonnes of confiscated ivory currently being held as court evidence saying: ‚ÄúWhilst Government remains committed to fight wildlife crime, including protection of iconic species of elephants and rhinos... it is important that the entire stockpile of ivory is destroy<span class="text_exposed_show">ed once and for all.‚Äù</span>
<div class="text_exposed_show">

We‚Äôre delighted to hear that the Government remains committed to saying to say ‚Äòno‚Äô to ivory and the illegal wildlife trade, and eagerly await the rescheduled burning.
