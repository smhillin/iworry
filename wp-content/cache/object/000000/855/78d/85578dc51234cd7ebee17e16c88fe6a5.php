Yet if the massacre isnâ€™t haltedâ€”and soonâ€”an ancient, graceful species that once roamed the earth in the tens of millions could vanish within a generation, jeopardizing humanity as well as the environment.
<p style="font-weight: 100;">That urgent message is at the heart of <a href="http://www.takepart.com/pivot/gardeners-of-eden"><em>Gardeners of Eden</em></a>, a powerful documentary produced by Kristin Davis, an actor best known as the kindhearted but lovelorn yuppie Charlotte York on the hit TV showÂ <em>Sex and the City</em>. In real life, Davis is a passionate environmental activist committed to saving African elephants, one at a time if necessary.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 100;">With elephants vanishing from the wild, â€œI feel like itâ€™s a tipping point,â€ saidÂ Davis, who screened the 61-minute film at the U.S. Department of State in Washington, D.C., as part of its Earth Day events. Poachers, she added, â€œhave no qualms about anything theyâ€™re doing. Theyâ€™ve committed themselves to the dark side. And thatâ€™s why the rest of us have to stand up and say we actually care. We have to tell our lawmakers we care.â€</p>
