<p class="arcticle_text" style="color: #000000;">Cheng Jie Liang had handled more than 3 000 pieces of illegally chopped elephant tusks, some still seeping with blood, the court heard. Liang is on trial for the illegal possession of 3 232 African elephant tusks and finished ivory products worth about R21 million. The ivory was found in two storerooms at The Storage Spot - a storage facility in Potsdam Road in Table View in 2012.</p>
<p class="arcticle_text" style="color: #000000;">He pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p class="arcticle_text">Fingerprint expert Theresa Wernich testified and said she had positively identified six of Liang‚Äôs fingerprints on cardboard boxes and plastic bags where the ivory was packed. Wernich compared Liang‚Äôs prints taken by police to those taken from the scene.</p>
<p class="arcticle_text">‚ÄúNo two people have the same print. I compared the prints lifted at the crime scene to that of police and found an identical match to Mr Liang,‚Äù she said.</p>
