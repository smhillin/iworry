Italy has crushed ivory believed to be valued at Â£3.6 million at the Circus Maximus in Rome in first event of its kind.Â Government officials helped to load the tusks and carved models into an industrial stone crusher and a steamroller before the pieces were disposed of permanently.

Thanks to our friendsÂ at <a href="http://www.pengolifeproject.it/" target="_blank">Pengo Life Project</a>Â we are able to share these exclusive images of the event which took place on Thursday 31st March.

This crush comes one month before Kenya destroy the majority of its ivory stockpile, at 105 tonnes of ivory and 1.35 tonnes of rhino horn.
