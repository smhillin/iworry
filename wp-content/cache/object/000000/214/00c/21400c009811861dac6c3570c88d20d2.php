<strong>Buying and importing new elephant ivory already has been banned by the federal government since 1988, but any ivory that was already in the United States before that dateÂ is legal to sell.</strong>Â The new bill, sponsored by Rep. Eric Pettigrew, D-Seattle, would change that in Washington.Â "This bill will not only save endangered animals, but will stop money from illegal ivory trade from going to fund a wide variety of illegal activities around the world" says Representative Eric Pettigrew.
