Scanlon, has awarded four CITES Secretary-Generalâ€™s Certificates of Commendation for exemplary wildlife law enforcement efforts.</span>

<span style="color: #3b3b3b;">China, Kenya and the Lusaka Agreement Task Force (LATF) were awarded Certificates of Commendation for collaborative efforts to take down an international criminal syndicate smuggling ivory from Kenya to China. The joint action occurred during Operation COBRA II â€“ an international wildlife law enforcement operation involving 28 countries that took place in January 2014 â€“ and resulted in the extradition of a Chinese national from Kenya to China and the arrest of more than 20 smugglers and domestic ivory traders in China implicated in the activities of the syndicate. </span>

The Certificates of Commendation presented to Chinaâ€™s National Inter-agencies CITES Enforcement Coordination Group on behalf of Chinese authorities, Kenya Wildlife Service on behalf of Kenyan Authorities and the Lusaka Agreement Task Force recognized the exemplary collaboration, including the daily exchange of real-time intelligence, which underpinned the joint investigation.
