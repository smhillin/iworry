"Through this act of destruction, we are sending a clear message to criminals: Belgium does not tolerate the trafficking of ivory or its consequences on elephant populations," Vice Prime Minister Laurette Onkelinx said, according to Belga news agency.

The destroyed objects included sculptures, jewellery, chopsticks and Japanese hanko seals, as well as raw tusks.
