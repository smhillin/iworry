<p style="text-align: left;" align="centre">The International March for Elephants is a social movement, allowing people to show their support for elephants and to draw public and political attention to what is happening to Africa's threatened wildlife.</p>

<p><strong>Who are you marching for?</strong></p>
<p>Personal stories have impact and so many of the orphaned elephants in the care of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust are the victims of ivory poaching, they deserve to have their stories told. So we have created a series of images in their honor and please feel free to download and print any of these, allowing you to take the orphans with you on the march. </p>
