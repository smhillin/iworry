‚ÄúThis is the first time that fingerprinting on ivory has been thoroughly investigated and a practical solution offered,‚Äù said Dr Leon Barron, a lecturer in forensic science at King‚Äôs College London.

‚ÄúThe only other study carried out over a decade ago simply showed that fingerprints were unstable and that the clarity of ridge detail was low, making it difficult to make reliable identifications.‚Äù

The new powders are most effective when used within seven days after a print was deposited, suggesting the method would work best in the field; however experts found that they were still able to lift some usable prints up to 28 days after they were deposited. The researchers also found that the tests also work for rhino ivory, hippo teeth and sperm whale teeth.
