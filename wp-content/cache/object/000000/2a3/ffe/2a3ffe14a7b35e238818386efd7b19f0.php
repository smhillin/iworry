<strong>April 2nd 2014:</strong> When an elephant was killed last week at the Aberdare National Park, MrÂ Allan Wanyama, a game ranger, wept.

Cameras caught the distraught ranger, rifle in hand, crying as he stood desolately over the animal, which still had blood oozing from its wounds.

â€œIt was a mixture of emotion and bitterness,â€ explains Wanyama, 24. â€œAtÂ that moment I wouldÂ not haveÂ  spared any of the poachers. I almost lost my mind at the sight of the carcass of the animal, which was everybodyâ€™s favourite at the park.â€

He adds that he had developed a close attachment to the animal during the period he had served at the park.
