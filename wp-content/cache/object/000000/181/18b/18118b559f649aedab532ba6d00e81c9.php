With the largest population in the world, China is also known to be the biggest market for ivory trade.</span>
<p style="color: #444444;">In East Asia, ivory crafts have long been highly regarded, as they represent wealth and nobleness. However, since China joined the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species in 1990, purchasing ivory has been discouraged.</p>
<p style="color: #444444;">"International trade of ivory is illegal and China has been improving public awareness of this. We have put up signs at international airports to warn against the buying and trading of ivory products. Our embassies in African countries also send text messages to visiting Chinese tourists to remind them not to bring home any ivory crafts," Jiang Zhigang, researcher with Chinese Academy Of Social Sciences, said.</p>
