The letter to Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying states: â€œWe applaud the government for taking a brave step in January 2014 to commit to the destruction by incineration of 29.6 tonnes of confiscated elephant ivory seized in Hong Kong since 1976. However, we believe that this does not go far enough, and that more needs to be done to curb demand for ivory and effectively diminish illegal trade and elephant poaching.

The killing of elephants must be stopped and Hong Kong has a central role to play."

Following the letter and on the day of the huge ivory burn, Rob Brandford, Director of the DSWT added, "We commend the government of Hong Kong for adopting a strong stance in opposition to the illegal ivory trade and call on them to take this commitment a vital step further, with the imposition of a complete ban on all ivory sales in Hong Kong."
